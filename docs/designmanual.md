This pattern library is a UI/UX style guide that provides pattern documentation for designers, developers, and web producers creating assets for the City of Bloomington (IN) web properties. 

## Design principles

Our design framework allows us to create a website that:

1. Renders across a range of browsers
The City of Bloomington website displays consistently and legibly on a wide range of devices using a mobile-first approach, a responsive design based on a flexible grid system, and industry-standard technologies.

2. Has a consistent UI, visual style, navigation, and interaction
To provide a unified experience, we ensure that persistent elements and components exist throughout the site to help users navigate it. Through our consistent implementation of color, design, branding, and navigational elements, users should be able to orient themselves wherever they may be within the site.

3. Contains searchable and findable content
In addition to a hierarchical navigational structure, we provide a persistent search function, the principal method users find data on the web. Whether they drill down, traverse, perform a site search, or arrive at the site from a search engine, users should be able to find what they need quickly, and we provide the means to do so with a logical content hierarchy, a robust search function, and search-engine-optimization techniques.

4. Is accessible
We implement a user-centric design for a wide variety of users, no matter their abilities or skill level. It's simple and intuitive, using clear typography and distinct page sections. You don't have to be a techie to use it.

## CSS
Documentation of typographic styles displayed across sites.

### Font
The site uses Work Sans as its main font. Base size is 20px.

*We use Sass variables for font weights.*

### Font Weights

### Foundational Headings
Default styling of page headings. These are semantic headings with no classes. (There will, however, be cases when the semantic won't match the visual hierarchy of a page. For example, a complex page may have several semantic h1's, but some of them may visually be required to look like h2. In those cases, use heading classes to make the page visually consistent.)

### Additional Headings

### Paragraphs

### Lists

### Block Quote

### Center


## Components
## Javascript
## Templates

## Colors

These are the approved colors for use on the site. We use SASS variables to set colors.

### Department Section Colors
### Text and Background Colors
### Gray Background Colors
### Data Visualization Colors
